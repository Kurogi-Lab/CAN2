# CAN2
## Description
The competitive associative net CAN2 is a neural network that learns a nonlinear function using the functions of the competitive net and the associative net and approximates it as a piecewise-linear function.<br>
The effectiveness of this net has already been shown by applications to nonlinear time-varying plant control, precipitation estimation, learning problem of nonlinear function and other problems. <br>
